# Delayed-Call-Telephone-Simulation
The simulation of a telephone call system, where the calls which couldn't be connected wait for lines to get free, and then connect once a line is free.

I created this project during my sixth semester while studying the course Simulation and Modeling.

To run:
* Open terminal in root directory
* Type this command and press enter:
'''
